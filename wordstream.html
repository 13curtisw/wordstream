						<h2>PPC - Achieve More Efficient Pay-Per Click (PPC) Marketing</h2>
						<p>
							<strong>PPC</strong> (<a href="">pay-per click</a>) search marketing software offers a means for accomplishing two core requirements for PPC optimization:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>PPC Automation</strong> - While it would be impossible (and inadvisable!) to automate every aspect of <a href="">pay-per click advertising</a>, automating away redundant, time-consuming tasks affords you a means of increasing productivity. Often, this means being able to produce an amount of work that would otherwise have been unachievable for you and your business.

								<p>
									<strong>PPC Management</strong> - <a href="">PPC management</a> refers to the maintainance and prioritization of <a href="">paid search</a> marketing tasks. Being able to oversee various aspects of your account while assigning each item on a seemingly endless to-do list an appropriate value can make or break an <a href="">online ad campaign</a>.
